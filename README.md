Support Writing C Programs During My Internship
During my internship, a major part of my work involved writing programs in the C language. As a beginner in practical programming, I faced various challenges while working on real-world coding tasks such as file operations, data structures, error handling, and logic building. One tool that proved highly helpful throughout this process was ChatGPT. It did not do the work for me, but it assisted in understanding logic, fixing common errors, and improving the overall quality of my code.

1. Understanding the Problem and Planning the Logic
When I was given a new programming task, especially one involving file handling or data structures like linked lists or arrays, I first used ChatGPT to help understand what the program was actually supposed to do. For example, if I was assigned to "create a program to read and write data to a file in C", I would ask ChatGPT to explain the flow of such a program or what functions might be needed.

ChatGPT helped break the problem into simple steps: opening the file using fopen(), writing data using fprintf() or fputs(), reading using fscanf() or fgets(), and finally closing the file with fclose(). Based on this, I could then build the logic on my own. This gave me confidence to approach the task independently.

2. Exploring Multiple Approaches
Sometimes there are multiple ways to write the same C program. ChatGPT helped me understand and compare different approaches. For example, when implementing a Run-Length Encoding (RLE) compression algorithm in C, I initially had no idea where to start. But after asking for a basic idea from ChatGPT, it gave a simple logic using loops and conditions that I used as a reference. I then customized it according to my assignment’s requirements. This not only saved time but also helped me explore variations and select the best-fit solution.

3. Fixing Errors and Debugging Code
Debugging is a major part of programming, and as an intern, I frequently ran into errors that I didn’t fully understand—such as segmentation faults, missing semicolons, incorrect file paths, or logic errors. Instead of spending too much time trying to guess the mistake, I would copy the error message and ask ChatGPT what it meant.

For example, I once had the issue “cannot open file” while testing a file-handling program. I asked ChatGPT about it, and it suggested checking the file path and whether the file existed or not. That simple guidance helped me quickly locate the issue and fix it. I learned from every debugging suggestion, which gradually made me better at identifying mistakes on my own.

4. Learning Syntax and Best Practices
Although I had learned C in theory before my internship, I wasn’t fully confident about its syntax and structure. ChatGPT helped me with small queries like the difference between gets() and fgets(), or when to use malloc() and how to free memory. It also suggested good practices like checking if a file pointer is NULL before using it, or always closing a file after use. These were small things, but they made my code more reliable and professional.
